# Hyper-parameter Tuning for Adversarially Robust Models


This repository contains the scripts and data used and collected in our study entitled [Hyper-parameter Tuning for Adversarially Robust Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02497.pdf).

The directory `train` contains the scripts and information to deploy the training of models.

The directory `optimizers` contains the code to implement the hyper-parameter tuning optimizers compared in this work (namely, taKG, HB, BO-EI, and Random Search).

The directory `datasets` contains the data collected in our study. We are making this data publicly accessible in the hope that it will aid
the design of future HPT methods specialized for Adversarial Training.
